It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
GeoServer is an open source server-side software written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. In this course, youâ€™ll start by learning how to develope a Spatial Analysis Platform with Web Processing Services. Then youâ€™ll see how to develop an algorithm by chaining together geospatial analysis processes, which you can share with anyone in the world. 

Next youâ€™ll dive into a very important technique to improve the speed of your web map applicationâ€”tile caching. Here, youâ€™ll understand how tile caching works, how to develop an effective tile cache-supported web service, and how to leverage the tile cache in your OpenLayers web application.

Further on, youâ€™ll see important tweaks to produce a performant GeoServer-backed web mapping application. By properly configuring your GeoServer instance, you can avoid performance bottlenecks for your end user. Next, weâ€™ll enable authentication and identity management for your application, where youâ€™ll build a user-specific and secure web application through identity management and authentication. Moving on, youâ€™ll enable authentication on the front and back ends to protect sensitive map data, and how to deliver sensitive data to your end user. 

Finally, youâ€™ll see how to put your web application into production in a secure and user-friendly way. Here, weâ€™ll look at hosting of the OpenLayers, GeoServer, and data aspects of your application. Youâ€™ll go beyond traditional web hosting to explore the full range of hosting options in the cloud, and maintaining a reliable server instance
